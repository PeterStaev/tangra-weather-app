# Tangra's Summer Loving Weather App

The application uses Telerik NativeScript UI Pro. In order to compile you must download your trial copy from [here](http://www.telerik.com/nativescript-ui). 
After that you must replace the path to the `.gz` file in the `package.json` and point it to where you have installed Telerik's Nativescript UI Pro. Finally run the app using `tns run ios` 

Note currently there is bug in iOS that clicking on a chart does not send the `pointIndex` property to the underlying event handler ([#4](https://github.com/telerik/nativescript-â€¦) ). 
In order to fix it after `npm install` you must change line 57 in `node_modules/nativescript-telerik-ui-pro/chart/chart.ios.js` from `pointIndex: index.intValue` to `pointIndex: index`. 

Also keep in mind for Android there are currently many issues and limitations of the chart controls, so full functionality of the app is available only on iOS.
